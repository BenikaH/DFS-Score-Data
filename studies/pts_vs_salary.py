"""
The purpose of this program is to show the relationship between a players salary
and his points obtained.  I think it can be used to:
    1. Set a benchmark for points needed when targeting a player at a given
    salary.
    2. Find any price points that might be inefficient.
        - If there is any salary that is severely above or below the trend
        line then it would probably be a good salary to avoid or target, respectively.
        As the results would have it, all of the salaries seemed to fall pretty
        close to the trend line, showing that DraftKings has their players
        priced pretty accurately.
        Note: The two outliers at the end of the avg points plot are likely so
        far off due to a small sample size of players at that salary.
